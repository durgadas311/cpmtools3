This package allows to access CP/M file systems similar to the well-known
mtools package, which accesses MSDOS file systems.  I use it for file
exchange with a Z80-PC simulator, but it works on floppy devices as well.
Currently it contains:

o  cpmls - list sorted directory with output similar to ls, DIR, P2DOS
   DIR and CP/M3 DIR[FULL]
o  cpmcp - copy files from and to CP/M file systems
o  cpmrm - erase files from CP/M file systems
o  cpmchmod - change file permissions
o  cpmchattr - change file attributes
o  mkfs.cpm - make a CP/M file system
o  fsck.cpm - check and repair a CP/M file system (only simple errors
   can be repaired so far).  Some images of broken file systems are provided
   for testing.
o  fsed.cpm - view CP/M file system
o  manual pages for everything including the CP/M file system format

All CP/M file system features are supported.  Password protection
is ignored, because passwords are easy to decrypt, but a pseudo file
[passwd] contains them, if you are curious what your old password has
been.  The disk label is read as special file [label].  User numbers
are specified as user:file.

Cpmtools should compile and work out of the box on each POSIX compliant
system.  It can be additionally compiled for Win32 systems.  The source
is available as a GNU zipped tape archive from:
