.SH DESCRIPTION \"{{{
\fBcpmcp\fP copies one or more files to or from a CP/M disk.  When copying
multiple files, the last argument must be a drive or directory.  The drive
letter does not matter because the device is specified by the image, it is
only used to specify which direction you want to copy.  The user number is
specified after the drive letter, if omitted user 0 is used.
.PP
You can use \fB*\fP and \fB?\fP in CP/M file names, which have the same
meaning in
.IR sh (1)
file name patterns.
.PP
On CP/M, the slash is a legal file name character.  When copying such files
to the host, it is translated to a comma.  Filenames with a comma have that
translated back to a slash on CP/M.  That is no restriction, because a comma
is not a legal CP/M filename character.
