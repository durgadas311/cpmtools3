  Under Windows 95/98, if a program name has more than one dot, you have to
add the ".exe" extension to the command. So you should use "fsck.cpm.exe" 
rather than just "fsck.cpm".

  If you have appropriate rights, the CPMTOOLS should be able to access
the floppy drive by using "A:" or "B:" as the name of the disc image. 
"mkfs.cpm" and "fsed.cpm" don't have this capability.
