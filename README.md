## cpmtools3

This is branched off from cpmtools 2.23 and reformatted into modern C style code.
New features are added to support MP/M timestamps as well as the ability to
link in code that auto-detects CP/M format (DPB) for simulator disk images
(etc.) where format details (or DPBs) are available.

cpmtools - Tools to access CP/M file systems
============================================

This package allows to access CP/M file systems similar to the well-known
mtools package, which accesses MSDOS file systems. It can be used for file
exchange with a Z80-PC simulator, but it works on floppy devices as well.

Currently it contains:

- `cpmls` - list sorted directory with output similar to ls, DIR, P2DOS DIR
   and CP/M3 DIR
- `cpmcp` - copy files from and to CP/M file systems
- `cpmrm` - erase files from CP/M file systems
- `cpmchmod` - change file permissions
- `cpmchattr` - change file attributes
- `mkfs.cpm` - make a CP/M file system
- `fsck.cpm` - check and repair a CP/M file system
- `fsed.cpm` - view CP/M file system
- manual pages for everything including the CP/M file system format

All features of CP/M file systems are supported.

## Compilation

### Requirements

You will need an ANSI standard C compiler, prefered is the GNU CC.
Optional you can build against the disk image library `libdsk`.
You should by able to compile and work out of the box on each POSIX
compliant system (Linux, BSD and MacOS).  It can be additionally
compiled for Win32 or Cygwin systems.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev
```

**Only when you want to compile against the disk image library libdsk**:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libdsk4-dev ### OR: libdsk5-dev
```

### Get the Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lipro-cpm4l/cpmtools.git
cd cpmtools
```

### Build and install the binary

```bash
./configure
make all
sudo make install
```
